Status : Parked

FFFlouride.xyz is a webserver being developed by 2 Devs using a 6 language stack called "PLEABS".

The original stack that was intended to be used ran as "PLEB", refering to the use of Python, Linux, Elm and Bash. This was only version one however.

Version two changes to "PLEBS" as we decided to add SSH for security. Hence stacking Python, Linux, Elm, Bash and SSH.

We intend the host the server on a Raspberry Pi Model 3b+, potentually to built into a cyberdeck for easy access to the website should we need to change any secific componets from the host itself, giving us direct access to the website itself.

Allas came Stack Version 3, "PLEABS". The languages run as follows:
  - Python - Data storage 
  - Linux - OS for the raspberry pi, more specifically raspbian
  - Elm - Front end similar to html and java
  - Appache - Remote access to the website
  - Bash - Backend of the website 
  - SSH - security of the website
  
This project is NOT open source as of yet and select developers MAY gain access to contribution, this is not guaranteed however.

As we work on the project and create new files, all of the websites updates will be uploaded here in order to be used as a learning tool for new coders or those looking for a live and up to date webserver project to look at.

We are more than welcome to hear your opinions on the webserver should you see any problems with it or have an idea on how to optimise the webserver for any lower-end devices.
